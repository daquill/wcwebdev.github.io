# Limitless Reflection

## Challenges
Some of the challenges I faced when coding the CSS and HTML portions of the site was Positioning. No matter what I did sometimes the elements would just act really weird and not behave like I wanted them to or how they should react.  
  
  
## Changes from Wireframe  
- Removed the Recently Joined Servers panel as this course does not contain any scripting and putting this on there would be a waste of space  
+ The background contains a blue-purpleish background gradient which looks really amazing with the layout of the elements  
  
## Future Planned Changes
+ Adding more content to the index page  
+ Adding a summary video of what our company is  
+ Adding a FAQ section
